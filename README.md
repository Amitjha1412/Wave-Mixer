Wave-Mixer
==========

An interface with following functionalities: ● Amplitude Scaling : Given a wave­form you have to scale with certain amount. ● Time Shift : Given a wave­form shift it along time axis. ● Time Scaling : Given a wave­from scale it along time axis. ● Time reversal : Reverse the wave along time axis. ● Mixing : This is a necessary feature for this assignment, you have to set certain values (mentioned above) for each wave selected and then mix them to get another wave as output. ● Modulation : Similarly, here also you have to set certain values for each wave selected and then modulate them to get another wave as output.
